## What is Edge App

Edge App is an application installed on various devices to perform inference functions of AI models.

### Features

#### Performing Inference
Edge App carries out the inference of AI models on the installed device. This involves the model processing input data to perform tasks such as predictions or classifications.

#### Data Collection and Validation
Edge App is responsible for acquiring the data needed for inference. It ensures the validity of the data, which is crucial for the model to produce accurate results. The quality and reliability of the data directly impact the model's performance.

#### Error Detection and Handling
Edge App detects and handles issues or errors that may occur during the inference process. This is vital for maintaining the model's stability and ensuring reliability in real-world operational environments.

#### Transmitting Data to Edge Conductor
The results of inferences or other critical information are sent to Edge Conductor. Edge Conductor manages communication and data flow between multiple devices, allowing centralized management of inference results and facilitating collaboration across various devices.

Edge App enables devices to utilize AI models locally, saving network bandwidth and providing efficient solutions for situations requiring real-time responses.
